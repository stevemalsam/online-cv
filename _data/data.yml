    company: New Relic, Remote
    details: |
      I worked as a Senior Mobile Engineer at New Relic. I was responsible for leading the iOS team and working on the New Relic iOS Mobile Agent. This involved leading feature development, as well as rotations on support. One of the most challenging aspects of this role was how often we would have to debug issues with the agent, without any kind of reproduction case available. This required a lot of problem solving and creative thinking to figure out what was going wrong.
        - Led feature development on the New Relic iOS Agent in Objective-C and Swift for low latency performance monitoring and crash diagnostics.
        - Architected and implemented the Mobile Session Replay feature, supporting UIKit, SwiftUI, Android, and Jetpack Compose, optimizing data collection and storage efficiency to minimize application impact. Coordinated with multiple teams to setup backend and player.
        - Drove significant gains in customer retention and data ingest 45% by enhancing cross-platform support for the iOS agent across Flutter, React Native, and Maui.
        - Increased data ingest by 20% by adding watchOS support for the mobile agent, seamlessly integrating event tracking into the watch app lifecycle.
        - Empowered team by mentoring junior engineers, conducting 1:1 coaching, running Agile Scrum ceremonies, and running process improvements such as team coding time.
        - Replaced legacy event processing logic, introducing a more resilient queuing system that reduced race conditions and eliminated the \#1 cause of agent crashes.
        - Implemented Swift Package Manager (SPM) support, allowing over 32,000 clients to integrate the iOS agent through it.
